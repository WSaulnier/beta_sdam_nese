             biological characteristics of streams and their adjacent riparian areas. 
             Such hydrologic information supports many management decisions. 
             One important aspect of hydrologic regime is streamflow durationâ€”the length of time that a stream supports sustained surface flow. 
             However, requisite hydrologic data to determine flow duration is unavailable at most reaches nationwide. 
             Although maps, hydrologic models, and other data resources exist 
             (e.g., the <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#qt-science_support_page_related_con\">

             </a>), 
             they may exclude small headwater streams, and limitations on accuracy and spatial or temporal resolution may reduce their utility for many management applications. 
             Therefore, there is a need for rapid, field-based methods to determine flow duration class at the reach scale in the absence of long-term hydrologic data 
             (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/12/9/2545\">Fritz et al., 2020</a>)")),
